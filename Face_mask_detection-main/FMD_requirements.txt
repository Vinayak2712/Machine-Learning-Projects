To work on the Face Mask Detection project in Jupyter Notebook, you will need to install the following dependencies:

1. Python (version 3.6 or above)
2. Jupyter Notebook (you can install it using pip: `pip install jupyter`)
3. NumPy (install with: `pip install numpy`)
4. OpenCV (install with: `pip install opencv-python`)
5. TensorFlow (install with: `pip install tensorflow`)
6. Keras (install with: `pip install keras`)
7. Matplotlib (install with: `pip install matplotlib`)
8. Pandas (install with: `pip install pandas`)

These dependencies provide the essential libraries and frameworks for working with images, performing deep learning tasks, and visualizing the results in Jupyter Notebook.

Remember to import the necessary libraries at the beginning of your Jupyter Notebook file using the import statements, such as:

```python
import numpy as np
import cv2
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
```

With these dependencies in place, you'll be all set to dive into the exciting world of face mask detection using Jupyter Notebook!
